	<p>Tea culture is a beautiful artistic conception of the entire tea tasting process including the appreciation of tea tasting techniques and artistic manipulation methods and the appreciation of the beautiful environment of tasting tea. The process reflects the mutual unity of form and spirit, and is a cultural phenomenon formed in the process of tea drinking activities. It has a long origin, a long history, a profound cultural heritage, and a connection with religion. Tea art includes a series of contents such as tea selection, water selection, tea making technology, tea set art, and environment selection and creation. The background of tea art is an important means to set off the theme. It renders the pure, elegant, and simple temperament of tea, and enhances the artistic appeal. Different styles of tea art have different background requirements. Only by choosing the right background can you better understand the taste of tea.</p><br>
